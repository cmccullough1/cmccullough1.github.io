                    <p>Here at Armor Credit Solutions, we are committed to educating our clients, finance specialists, realtors and loan officers. We will provide credit score education to our clients as we find most consumers do not know as much as they should about credit and finance.  The credit industry is ever-changing and we take responsibility to inform our clients and referral partners on market changes, changes in credit law, changes in credit scoring and education in how to grow and protect credit scores.</p>

                    <h2 class="why-choose-header">Consumer Rights</h2>

                    <p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) deals with the rights of consumers in relation to their credit reports and the obligations of credit reporting agencies and the businesses that provide information to them. The FCRA has been revised numerous times since it took effect in 1971, notably by passage of the Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). The FACT Act created new responsibilities for consumer reporting agencies and users of consumer reports, many concerning consumer disclosures and identity theft. It also created new rights for consumers, including the right to free annual consumer reports and improved access to report information, with the aim of making data in the consumer reporting system more accurate</p>
